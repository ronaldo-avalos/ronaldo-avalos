## 🧑🏻‍💻 I'm Ronaldo avalos. i build things. sometimes i share them.  

I'm a design engineer and currently specialize in Swift, but I also know Kotlin I strive to make my work as clean and visually appealing as possible, but that doesn't mean I focus solely on aesthetics, I also prioritize functionality. Along the way, I often develop small tools, libraries or components to solve recurring problems. If they prove useful, I share them with the community. 

### 📦 📱 Open source stuff that I share with the community and some apps that I've made:  
- <a href="https://github.com/ronaldo-avalos/ZoomImageView">ZoomImageView </a>  – A SwiftUI component that provides an image view with zoom and pan functionality.
- <a href="https://github.com/ronaldo-avalos/SpotifyVieoPlayer"> SpotifyVieoPlayer </a> - A SwiftUI-based music player replicating Spotify's video playback experience, featuring background videos.
- <a href="https://github.com/ronaldo-avalos/AvatarAiPayWall"> AvatarAiPayWall </a> - A beautifully designed paywall screen built with SwiftUI as a practice project. Inspired by modern subscription flows, this paywall offers a seamless user experience with animated elements.
