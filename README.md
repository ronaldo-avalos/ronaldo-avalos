Iâ€™m a design engineer currently specializing in Swift, with experience in Kotlin. I strive to make my work clean and
visually appealing, without neglecting functionality. Along the way, I develop tools, libraries, or components to
solve recurring problems, which I share with the community when useful.

### ðŸ“¦ ðŸ“± Open source stuff that I share with the community and some apps that I've made:  
- <a href="https://github.com/ronaldo-avalos/ZoomImageView">ZoomImageView </a>  â€“ A SwiftUI component that provides an image view with zoom and pan functionality.
- <a href="https://github.com/ronaldo-avalos/SpotifyVieoPlayer"> SpotifyVieoPlayer </a> - A SwiftUI-based music player replicating Spotify's video playback experience, featuring background videos.
- <a href="https://github.com/ronaldo-avalos/AvatarAiPayWall"> AvatarAiPayWall </a> - A beautifully designed paywall screen built with SwiftUI as a practice project. Inspired by modern subscription flows, this paywall offers a seamless user experience with animated elements.
